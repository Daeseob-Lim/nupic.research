## Temporal Memory Examples

This directory contains a few files that demonstrate how to use Temporal Memory correctly. These examples illustrate various
interesting properties of the Temporal Memory algorithm.

`hello_tm.py` is the most basic example test of Temporal Memory. `tm_higher_order.py` is a significantly more complicated test of Temporal Memory that tests higher order sequences.
Both of these examples have been adapted from its [original versions](https://github.com/numenta/nupic/tree/master/examples/tm).
